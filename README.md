# devconnect
Social Node.js Site

This is a social media website meant for developers to connect. The website is built with Node.js, React, Redux, and uses a MongoDB database. This app was built following Udemy tutorials from Brad Traversy as a way to explore new coding techniques and expose myself to new development techniques with Javascript.
